1. Login derivation rotation.
    For security and hygenic uses, I rotate my login derivation, this mean I change my login keys. Credentials are not affected.
    This is rougly the same of changing my password if I suspect that my login security has been breached.
2. Entity derivation rotation.
    For more serious damage contention. I think that the private key for my interactions with an Entity has leaked. In this case I change the whole
    derivation for that entity. This affects login, the pre-existing credentials and presentations. Those must be revoked.
3. Identity derivation rotation.
    The most serious situation. My wallet has been compromised and I need to change my identity wallet, 
    generating the new security levels and the new identity wallet levels
    Chaning my identity requires new values for SSSSSW in the derivation schema (mZRSSSSSWMTN)
    Also my old key at mZRSSSSSW and mZRSSSSSWMTN has to be revoked, all the derived mZRSSSSSWB and subsequent keys algo have to be considered revoked
